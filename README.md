## 1. Introduction.
<img src="snort.png" height="100"> 
Snort is an open source intrusion prevention system capable of real-time traffic analysis and packet logging, created in 1998 by Martin Roesch, founder and former CTO of Sourcefire. Snort is now developed by Cisco, which purchased Sourcefire in 2013.

In 2009, Snort entered InfoWorld's Open Source Hall of Fame as one of the "greatest open source software of all time". Snort's open source network-based intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) has the ability to perform real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Snort performs protocol analysis, content searching and matching. The program can also be used to detect probes or attacks, including, but not limited to, operating system fingerprinting attempts, semantic URL attacks, buffer overflows, server message block probes, and stealth port scans.
